## About

I had purchased this course from the Udemy training platform as it has had recent updates with many postitive reviews and ratings.

The purpose of studying this course are as follows:

In past I have used HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript in the past and within a commerical setting. However, that was a while ago and there has been some development since then. This course will not only refresh my memory but get me up to speed particularly HTML5. Altough I have had a little training on Bootstrap, that was some time ago and with course I will get to learn the latest version of Bootstrap. Once I have completed all sections on HTML5, CSS2/3, Bootstrap and JavaScript develop my own portfolio website using those expact languages and framework.

I am also using this course for reference whilst on my current project within my full time job as although my focus is frontend development, there are times when there isn't any frontend tickets left and I need to take a backend ticket from our Jira scrum board.
